**FEATURES:** 
- !clipso @teklynk to play a clip from a channel while the clips reel is playing. This will immediately play the clip from the channel and then continue on with the rest of the clips reel. 
- Control the clips from Twitch chat. !clipskip, !clippause, !clipplay, !clipreload, !clipso @channelname. Limited to Mods and Streamer.
- Show clips from channels that you follow. Grabs the most recent 700 channels.
- Use a custom command to start the clips reel and restrict it to Mods only.
- Type "!mycommand @teklynk @coolstreamer @gamer123 @tekbot" which will play the clips reel for only those channels. 
- Type "!mycommand" while the clips reel is playing to skip to the next clip. 
- Type "!mycommand stop" to stop the clips player.
- Date Range option: This will grab a clip from within the last 5days, 10day, 30days... If no clips exist, then skip to the next channel.
- Show clip details panel: This will display a panel in the lower third of the overlay that contains details about the clip. This can use variables:{channel},{title},{game},{creator_name},{created_at}.

## Notes:
Access is now required if you would like to show clips from channels that you follow or show a message in chat.

In OBS, set the browser source to: "Shutdown source when not visible" and "Refresh browser when scene becomes active". This will prevent the clips player from playing in the background. It will also reload/refresh the clips player when the source becomes active.
